#### Our Mission

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
  <p>Ensemble Meliora is a historical performance ensemble based on the East Coast with musicians hailing from Chicago, NYC, Rochester, Baltimore, and beyond. Driven by a vivacious excitement for the weird and wonderful corners of forgotten early music, we actively strive toward an ever better collection of historical repertoire that expands and redefines the story of music. Our mission is to share early music with wider audiences and transform the concert experience into something welcoming, inclusive, and accessible to all.
 </p>

  <p>The seeds of our ensemble were planted in the classrooms of the Eastman School of Music. The spark of creativity was ignited amongst members of the Collegium Musicum, a place where musicians could experiment and broaden their musical horizons. Inspired by Eastmanâ€™s motto, <em>Meliora (ever better)</em>, we formed an ensemble dedicated to discovery through experimentation, to provide an ever better experience for our community, and an ever better understanding of music history.  Through research, we discover forgotten works and bring them to light. Through community, we establish spaces where all audiences are welcome. Through our love for early music, we show that the creativity of the past can inspire the imagination of the present. We strive toward <em>meliora</em> for all who believe that music can lift the human spirit, illuminate our history, and unite us in harmony. </p>
