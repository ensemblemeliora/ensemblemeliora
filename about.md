## Mission

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto;">
  <p>
Ensemble Meliora is committed to sharing early music with diverse audiences, regardless of prior experience with early music, classical instruments, or live concerts. As a group of musicians who are passionate about rediscovering forgotten works that deserve a place in the canon of well-known historical repertoire, we are dedicated to introducing the public to these pieces through rigorous scholarship, the creation of new performance editions, and bringing these pieces to life by performing and recording contemporary ‘premieres’ of these works. By presenting our music in unusual and non-traditional venues, we endeavor to build a music-loving community that comes from many different personal and artistic backgrounds. </p>

  <p>In addition to our work in community performance spaces, we are dedicated to encouraging interest in early music through concerts, lectures, masterclasses, and coachings at both school and university music programs. We are excited to share our discoveries and performances with a wide variety of musical communities and beyond.</p>
