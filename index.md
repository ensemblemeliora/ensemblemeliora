    <p>
      <strong>Ensemble Meliora</strong> is a historical performance ensemble based on the East Coast, founded by Rachel Smith and Juliana Kauls-Kilcoyne. With musicians hailing from Chicago, NYC, Rochester, Baltimore, and abroad, all members of Ensemble Meliora work together to create programming that highlights unusual, forgotten, or unexplored corners of the early repertoire. We share our love for this music with audiences from all backgrounds at our free concerts.

Several members of Ensemble Meliora met during their time in the early music ensemble at the Eastman School of Music: the Eastman Collegium. Inspired by the school motto, Meliora, (ever better), we recruited fellow musicians and friends from the early music scene to form an ensemble which would work to make the world of music <em><strong>ever better</strong></em>.

  Through <strong>research</strong>, we discover forgotten works and bring them to light. Through <strong>community</strong>, we establish spaces where all audiences are welcome and concert admission is free. Through our <strong>love for early music</strong>, we hope to inspire and uplift others.
