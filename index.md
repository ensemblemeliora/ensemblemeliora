    <p>
    <strong>Ensemble Meliora</strong> is an early music group based in the East Coast. With members hailing from New York, Chicago, Baltimore, and abroad, Ensemble Meliora boasts a roster with some of today's most in-demand young performers. Meeting in undergraduate practice rooms, late night viol consort rehearsals, and summer festivals, we've put together a band of truly wonderful and inquisitive musicians and people. We hope you join us in our mission to become <strong><em>ever better</em></strong> through our exploration of the past.

  Ensemble Meliora is bringing rarely performed gems of the Baroque repertoire to life, spotlighting the <strong>quirky</strong>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <strong>beautiful</strong> corners of early music that deserve a broader audience. With every concert, we hope to challenge expectations and celebrate the expressive power of <strong>period performance</strong>.
